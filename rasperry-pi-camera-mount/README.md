Parts for a raspberry pi camera mount, based on Bravehartk2's design: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2737276.

* `face` is a redesign with slight adjustments to better fit my cameras (or maybe it was just to practice openscad, who can remember)
* `pip cylinder mount` is a replacement for the ball joint from the above project, because my prints kept breaking when I tried to combine the base and the ball joint.
* `mounting plate` is just a plate that the cylinder mount can slide onto, since the original had a socket for the ball joint.
